				<p class="caption"><span style="font-size: 18px"><b>Week4-6</b></span><br>I explored how to mix the ADs, including the interactive AD and the AD (caption) which comes with the film and has ready co-exist well with the other sounds in the film.<br><br>
					<span style="font-size: 18px"><b>Test 1: Sound mixing test</b></span><br>
					<b>Goal:</b><br>
					1. Is interactive AD, compared with the original caption, disruptive? Which form of the interactive AD is less disruptive?<br>
					2. How well they can perceive the sound information?<br>
					3. How well the interactive AD can help them imagine the scene?<br><br>

					<b>Questions Part1:<br>Experience the three prototypes below in random order. Answer Question 1 & 2 after each prototype ends.</b><br>
					<a href="./ISWeek4Test/week4TestInvSlow.html">Prototype1-Blindfolded-Normal speed</a><br>
					<a href="./ISWeek4Test/week4Test2InvSlow.html">Prototype2-Blindfolded-Normal speed</a><br>
					<a href="./ISWeek4Test/week4Test3InvSlow.html">Prototype3-Blindfolded-Normal speed</a><br>

					Q1: Is it difficult or easy to capture all the sound information in the soundtrack? Rate 1(hard)-10(easy).<br>
					Q2: Did you hear the following information? Check the items you heard.<br></p>

					<ul style="list-style-type: disc;color: gray; ">
						<li><p class="captionS">"Keep going, keeping going maggie. Come on now. Come one you got to keep pushing."</p></li>

							<li><p class="captionS">"No, no, no, I'm too tired. I can't do it."</p></li>
							<li><p class="captionS">"I'm too exhausted."</p></li>
							<li><p class="captionS">"One more big push."</p></li>
							<li><p class="captionS">"And got to give it everything you got, okay?"</p></li>
							<li><p class="captionS">"Cause your baby's heart rate, it's a little fast right now."</p></li>

							<li><p class="captionS">"Everything you got. Here we go."</p></li>

							Q3: On a scale from 1-10, rate your viewing experience with this prototype. (1-poor, 10-excellent)<br><br>


							<b>Questions Part2:<br> Watch the original video clip with the original Audio Description Caption and then answer the questions below.</b><br>
							<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B07VKRJNQH/ref=atv_dl_rdr?autoplay=1">Original video clip</a><br>
							Q4: On a scale from 1-10, rate how well the prototypes help you imagine what is displayed on the screen? (1-poor, 10-excellent)<br>
							Q5: On a scale from 1-10, rate the similarity between the scene you imagined in mind and the actual scene you saw? (1-not similar at all, 10-highly similar)
